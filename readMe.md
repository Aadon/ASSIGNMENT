## FAQ

#### Question 
What is the difference between git and gitHub?

Answer

Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.  GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.
#### Question 
What is git init and what does it do?

Answer 

This is the command you need to use if you want to start a new empty repository or to reinitialize an existing one in the project root. It will create a .git directory with its subdirectories. It should look like this: git init <repository name>
